# Python-PalmDB

Pure Python library to read/write/modify Palm PDB and PRC format databases.

## Description

This module allows access to Palm OS(tm) database files on the desktop 
in pure Python. It is as simple as possible without (hopefully) being 
too simple. As much as possible Python idioms have been used to make
it easier to use and more versatile.

This code is based on code from the Pyrite Project, available I believe
from SourceForge. However the code has been modified so extensively it's 
hardly recognizable. But without the Pyrite code, PalmDB would not be here
today.

## History

This is an unofficial fork of PalmDB which adds Python3 support.
Please see the [python2 branch](https://github.com/notpeter/python-palmdb/tree/python2) if you're looking
for the old upstream sources which support Python2.

PalmDB was created by [Blake Winton](https://github.com/bwinton) and [Rick Price](https://github.com/rickprice)
and is currently maintained by [Peter Tripp (notpeter)](https://github.com/notpeter/)

The [sourceforge svn](https://sourceforge.net/p/pythonpalmdb/code/HEAD/tree/) sources were imported to Git via the Github UI.

The project had its last official release (1.8.1) on 2007-09-28.
